Project 2 Work Outline
1. Create a pq-linklist.c and pq-minheap.c files
	- source code from write up doesnt work...
	- get it to compile/work
	- change n to 10,000

2. Base Simulation of Compiled Code
	- Once code is compiled, simulate using gem5/stable using TimingSimple CPU
		- Compile with -O2
		- Find break up of instructions for different op classes
			- I am not finding "op_class" in the file stats.txt
		- Run for both pq-*.c files

3. Simulate only on Sort Portion of Code
	- Compile with -S and -O2 to get assembly code
	- Add "#include "m5ops.h"" to the .c files
	m5 build


4. Pipleline Simulation


5. Compiler Simulation

Questions:
	- How to get main to work with the null, linklist and minheap implementations
	- Should we use n=10000 or n=1000?
